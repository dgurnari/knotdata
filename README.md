# Knot Polynomial Dataset Repository

This repository contains a collection of datasets for various knot invariants, including polynomial and homological data. Each dataset is stored in `.csv` format with coefficients or values organized by columns for ease of analysis and computational use.

## 📊 Included Invariants

| Invariant     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alexander polynomial**      | The first knot polynomial by J.W. Alexander in 1923.                        |
| **Jones polynomial**          | Knot polynomial by V. Jones arising from representation theory of $\displaystyle U_{q}({\mathfrak {sl}}_{2})$.       |
| **Theta polynomial**          | Very strong, computable, and fun 2-variable polynomial by D. Bar Natan and R. Van Der Veen.        |
| **HOMFLYPT polynomial**       | Two-variable polynomial generalizing both Alexander and Jones polynomials. |
| **Knot Floer homology**       | TO ADD |
| **Khovanov homology** | A categorification of the Jones polynomial by M. Khovanov 1999.      |

## 📁 Dataset Format

Each dataset is provided as a `.csv` file. Each row typically corresponds to a knot, and columns represent:

- Knot identifier
- Polynomial coefficients or homology ranks
- Additional scalar invariants (crossing number, alternating, signature, s invariant, etc.)

All datasets use the same knot identifier, following KnotScape's ordering for knots up to 16 crossings (e.g. `13n5109`) and Regina's ordering for 17 crossings knots (e.g. `17ns_29`). In general the knot identifier is of the form `c[an][tsh]_k`, where:

- `c` is the number of crossings;
- `[an]` indicates whether the knot is alternating or non-alternating (only for knots with more than 10 crossings);
- `[tsh]` indicates whether the knot is a torus, satellite or hyperbolic knot (only for 17 crossings knots);
- `k` is a positive integer that sorts the knots within each of these classes.

Please refer to each subdirectory’s `README.md` for format-specific notes.

## 📚 Credits and Data Generation

Alexander, Jones and HOMFLYPT data were generated using the KnotTheory package 

Khovanov homology data were generated by Dirk Schütz with [KnotJob](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/dirk.schuetz/knotjob.html) using PD-codes from [Knotscape](https://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~jhoste/HosteWebPages/kntscp.html) and [Regina](https://regina-normal.github.io/).

HFK data were generated by Davide Gurnari using [Snappy](https://snappy.computop.org/) from the PD-codes provided by Dirk Schütz.

Theta date were generated by Dror Bar-Natan and Roland van der Veen using [Sage](https://www.rolandvdv.nl/Theta/).
