# ðŸ§® Theta Polynomial Dataset

This dataset contains Theta polynomials for all prime knots up to 15 crossings, stored in a structured `.csv` format.

## ðŸ“„ File: `theta_upto15.csv`

Each row represents one knot, with associated metadata and polynomial coefficients.

| `knot_id`              | Knot identifier   |
| `number_of_crossings` | Minimal crossing number of the knot                                         |
| `table_number`         | Knot index within the set of knots with that crossing number               |
| `is_alternating`       | Boolean (1 or 0), indicating whether the knot is alternating                |
